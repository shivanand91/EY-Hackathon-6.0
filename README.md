## 🧠 Executive Summary

The current vehicle maintenance ecosystem is largely **reactive**, where faults are identified only after a breakdown occurs. This results in unexpected failures, increased repair costs, operational downtime, and poor customer experience.

Our project introduces an **Agentic AI-powered Autonomous Predictive Maintenance System** that proactively analyzes vehicle sensor data, predicts failures, explains them in simple language, and automatically recommends service actions.

The system is designed as a **multi-agent architecture**, enabling autonomous decision-making, explainability, and scalability for real-world deployment.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Vehicle fault detection is delayed, leading to breakdowns  
- Sensor data is technical and difficult for end users to understand  
- Service booking is manual and inefficient  
- OEMs lack real-time visibility into recurring defect patterns  
- Existing systems do not support autonomous, end-to-end maintenance workflows  

---

## 🌟 Solution Overview

We propose a **full-stack, AI-agent-based predictive maintenance platform** that:

- Detects anomalies in real-time vehicle sensor readings  
- Classifies fault severity using intelligent agents  
- Explains issues using LLM-powered natural language reasoning  
- Recommends optimal service slots and nearby workshops  
- Aggregates insights at the OEM level for long-term improvements  

---

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

Each responsibility is handled by a dedicated AI agent, coordinated by a master agent.

| Agent Name | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **DataAgent** | Cleans and normalizes vehicle sensor data |
| **DiagnosisAgent** | Detects faults and assigns severity levels |
| **ExplanationAgent (LLM)** | Converts technical diagnosis into simple explanations |
| **ServiceAgent** | Recommends service actions and booking slots |
| **OEMAgent** | Aggregates issues across vehicles for OEM insights |
| **MasterAgent** | Orchestrates agent workflow autonomously |

---

## 🔄 How the System Works

1. Vehicle sensor data is submitted via the frontend UI  
2. DataAgent preprocesses and validates the inputs  
3. DiagnosisAgent detects anomalies and fault severity  
4. ExplanationAgent generates a human-readable explanation  
5. ServiceAgent recommends workshops and service slots  
6. OEMAgent aggregates anonymized insights for manufacturers  

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ Autonomous fault detection (no manual intervention)  
- ✅ Explainable AI using LLM integration  
- ✅ One-click service booking recommendation  
- ✅ OEM-level analytics and insights  
- ✅ Modular, scalable agentic architecture  
- ✅ Fully working end-to-end prototype

## 🛠 Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js (Vite)** – Fast and scalable SPA  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Modern, responsive UI  
- **Axios** – REST API communication  

### Backend
- **Node.js & Express.js** – RESTful API services  
- **Agent-based architecture** – Modular intelligence layers  

### AI & Intelligence
- **LLM Integration** – Explainable diagnostics  
- **Hybrid Rule + AI logic** – Reliable predictions  

### Database
- **MongoDB** – Vehicle data, diagnosis history, service logs  

### Deployment
- **Vercel** – Frontend & backend deployment  
- **Environment-based configuration** – Secure and scalable

## 📊 OEM Insights (Enterprise Value)

The platform provides OEMs with aggregated, anonymized insights such as:

- Most frequent vehicle issues  
- Severity trends across models  
- Preventive design improvement opportunities  
- Data-driven recall and quality decisions  

---

## 🚀 Scalability & Future Scope

- EV-specific diagnostics  
- Fleet-level monitoring dashboards  
- Insurance & warranty integrations  
- Continuous learning from real-world data  
- IoT sensor integration  

---

## 🏆 Why This Solution Stands Out

- Not just predictive — **fully autonomous**  
- Explainable AI, not black-box predictions  
- Covers **customer + service + OEM** ecosystem  
- Built with real deployment and scalability in mind  

> *“This is not just predictive maintenance — it is autonomous vehicle care.”*
